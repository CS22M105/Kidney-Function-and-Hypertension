# Kidney-Function-and-Hypertension
This project investigates the relationship between kidney dysfunction and hypertension, with a particular focus on whether impaired kidney function contributes to elevated blood pressure via fluid retention.


Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2003–2004), the study applies:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Hypothesis testing
Multivariable regression
Logistic regression
Mediation (causal) analysis
Predictive modeling and validation

The analysis is implemented entirely in R, following a modular, reproducible, and research-oriented structure.

🎯 Research Questions

Does impaired kidney function (measured using Creatinine and Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio, ACR) influence blood pressure?

Does fluid retention (extracellular fluid) mediate the relationship between kidney dysfunction and hypertension?

Can kidney health markers be used to predict hypertension risk?

How do these relationships vary across demographic and health subgroups?
